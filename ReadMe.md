# MCP Learning

Repository of the goodness (example code and learning materials) from exploring the Model Context Protocol (MCP). The codebase includes a simple MCP client and server, utilities, and example chat integrations used while following the MCP introductory course.

Project layout
- `src/` — main example code and runnable scripts.


This repo was created while working through the "Introduction to Model Context Protocol" course from Anthropic. The course introduces MCP fundamentals, client/server patterns, message formats, and step-by-step examples to help you build MCP-aware applications.
